As scientists, you should be able to describe why you have reached that conclusion, e.g., by showing performance speedup graphs or slowdowns. Please comment on the behaviour you see, if it is linear in the amount of resources, sublinear, or something else, or if the CPU was the bottleneck, or the Memory, etc?
